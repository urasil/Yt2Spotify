This software does not use the Spotify API to put mp3's into a Spotify library. It downloads a video from YouTube, converts it into an
MP3, and puts it under the local Music directory under your user.

####How to use it?####
Enter the link to your YouTube video and click the download button.
###Make sure that your Spotify account has local files enabled###
If you don't know what that means, all you need to do is
1-Click on your user and click settings.
2-Scroll down until you see Your Library.
3-Enable the Show Local Files widget.
Now the audio of every video you download using this software will be available in Spotify while using your local device.

###A little disclaimer###
Songs take some time for Spotify to recognize and be able to play You might want to play with enable local files/enable music folder widget as it does help. I am not sure how to make Spotify recognize songs immediately however it eventually works so just be patient!
