# Yt2Spotify

This software does not use the Spotify API to put mp3's into a Spotify library. It downloads a video from YouTube, converts it into an MP3, and puts it under the local Music directory under your user. The reason behind this software is the song "Bullet from a gun" by Skepta. Although I love the song, I hate the lyrics. On YouTube, a remix, "Just Ur Turn" exists, which I much prefer. Hence this project.

## How to use it?

1. Enter the link to your YouTube video.
2. Click the download button.
3. Enable local files on Spotify and see your downloaded songs under the local files playlist in Spotify.
4. Enjoy!

### How to enable local files on Spotify?

If you don't know what that means, follow these steps:

1. Click on your user and click settings.
2. Scroll down until you see Your Library.
3. Enable the Show Local Files widget.

Now the audio of every video you download using this software will be available in Spotify while using your local device.

### A little disclaimer

Songs take some time for Spotify to recognize and be able to play. You might want to play with the "enable local files" or "enable music folder" widget as it does help. I am not sure how to make Spotify recognize songs immediately; however, it eventually works, so just be patient!
